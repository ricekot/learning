# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions to some of the problems from Advent of Code 2021.

## How to run
From this directory, 

```bash
perl day-1/part-2.pl day-1/input.txt
```
or
```bash
g++ day-3/part-2.cpp && ./a.out day-3/input.txt
```
or
```bash
python day-4/part-1.py day-4/input.txt
```

depending on the programming language the solution is written in.
