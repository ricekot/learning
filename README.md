# learning

Consolidating all my learning projects in one place, instead of creating a new repository for each one. I will be following a "slip-box" approach for now, so that each project is it's own folder in the root of this repository.

Some rules for myself: the names of all project folders must be in lowercase and words should be separated with hyphens. Each project folder must contain a README file.
